# Classification-of-Songs-with-Natural-Language-Processing-
In platforms like last.fm, users generally add tags to make the song get seen by those who wish listening them. Some users find what they will listen with these tags which includes information about the genres. Although, there are many missing tags which lead users spend more time finding what to listen. For this problem, I implemented machine learning algorithms to improve data quality of the last.fm, and the user experience.
